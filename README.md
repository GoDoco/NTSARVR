First release of this small game that you probably can't play if you don't have a phone listed here

https://developers.google.com/ar/devices?hl=fr

In vegetable samurai your goal is to cut through various vegetables which give you points
Green : 1
Silver : 3 
Gold : 5
Red : -5
if a vegetable falls to the floor (except if it's red) it will lower your score
you need to score 50 to win 

This game features Three levels of difficulty which makes the game go faster and put more vegetables around to cut

(This game isn't a serious project and it was made under one week for a school project so don't fret over it)
